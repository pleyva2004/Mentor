Production Integration Plan: Mentor Resume Helper (Phases 1-6)
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating the Mentor Resume Helper feature (Phases 1-6) into the production environment. The plan covers the full lifecycle from feature gap analysis through final rollout and communication. Its purpose is to provide a clear, actionable roadmap for engineering teams and stakeholders to ensure a seamless, maintainable, and high-quality implementation.

This plan is structured to align with the existing codebase architecture, as will be detailed in CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md, and to fully realize the specifications outlined in Mentor Resume Helper - Complete Feature Requirements. The visual and interactive elements will be based on the approved Front End Draft HTML prototype.

CRITICAL: This plan is currently a template. The detailed tasks, timelines, and dependencies within each section are blocked pending access to the content of the three source documents. All sections will be populated upon receipt of this information.

2. Feature Gap Analysis (Prototype vs. Requirements)
This phase is intended to identify all discrepancies and missing elements between the interactive prototype and the final feature requirements. The analysis will serve as the foundation for creating engineering tasks.

Objective: To create a definitive list of all frontend and backend work required to transition the prototype to a production-ready feature.
Inputs:
Front End Draft (HTML prototype)
Mentor Resume Helper - Complete Feature Requirements
Process:
Perform a side-by-side review of the Front End Draft against every requirement listed in the Complete Feature Requirements document.
Document all gaps, including missing UI components, incomplete user flows, required API endpoints, and necessary backend logic.
Categorize each gap by priority (P0-P3) and component (Frontend, Backend, API).
Outputs: A detailed gap analysis document that will directly inform the Implementation Roadmap.
Status: BLOCKED. Additional information needed: Content of Front End Draft and Complete Feature Requirements is required to proceed.
3. Implementation Roadmap (Frontend/Backend/API)
This roadmap will detail the phased development plan, organized by sprints or milestones. It will be derived directly from the Feature Gap Analysis and will respect the existing architecture outlined in the codebase documentation.

3.1 Frontend
Objective: Implement all UI components, user flows, and state management as required to meet the feature specification.
Dependencies: Completed Feature Gap Analysis, API contract definition.
Key Activities: Component development, integration with API services, state management setup, implementation of styling and responsiveness based on the Front End Draft.
Status: BLOCKED. Dependent on Feature Gap Analysis.
3.2 Backend
Objective: Develop all required business logic, database models, and service integrations.
Dependencies: Completed Feature Gap Analysis, database schema design.
Key Activities: Creation of new service endpoints, implementation of business logic from Complete Feature Requirements, database schema updates, and integration with third-party services if required. The architectural approach must align with CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md.
Status: BLOCKED. Dependent on Feature Gap Analysis.
3.3 API
Objective: Define and implement the API contract that will serve as the interface between the frontend and backend.
Dependencies: Completed Feature Gap Analysis.
Key Activities: Define request/response payloads, establish authentication/authorization mechanisms, and document endpoints.
Status: BLOCKED. Dependent on Feature Gap Analysis.
4. QA and Testing Strategy
A multi-layered testing strategy will be implemented to ensure the feature is robust, bug-free, and meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

Objective: To validate the implementation against the Complete Feature Requirements and ensure production stability.
Inputs: Complete Feature Requirements, finalized API documentation.
Strategy:
Unit Testing: Developers will write unit tests for all new frontend components and backend logic.
Integration Testing: QA will test the interactions between the frontend, backend, and API.
End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Automated and manual E2E tests will validate complete user flows as described in the requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Product and key stakeholders will perform final validation before rollout.
Status: BLOCKED. Additional information needed: Specific test cases cannot be created without the content of Complete Feature Requirements.
5. Documentation Integration Steps
All new components, services, and architecture changes must be documented in the central repository to ensure maintainability and facilitate onboarding for new engineers.

Objective: To update CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md with comprehensive information about the Mentor Resume Helper feature.
Inputs: Finalized code, API documentation.
Process:
Review the existing structure of CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md.
Add a new section for the Mentor Resume Helper feature.
Document the new frontend components, their props, and state management logic.
Document all new API endpoints, including request/response formats.
Update the architecture diagrams to reflect any changes.
Add to the backlog section for any planned future work.
Status: BLOCKED. Additional information needed: The current content of CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md is required to plan specific updates. This is also dependent on the completion of the Implementation Roadmap.
6. Production Readiness Checklist
This checklist serves as the final gate before deployment. All items must be completed and verified.

[ ] Code Complete: All development tasks from the Implementation Roadmap are merged.
[ ] Testing Passed: All unit, integration, and E2E tests are passing. UAT has been signed off.
[ ] Documentation Integrated: CODEBASE_DOCUMENTATION.md has been fully updated as per the integration steps.
[ ] Monitoring & Alerting: Logging, monitoring dashboards, and critical alerts are configured for new services.
[ ] Rollback Plan: A documented and tested rollback procedure is in place.
[ ] Dependencies Met: All infrastructure or service dependencies are provisioned and configured.
Status: Pending. Specific sub-items for each category will be defined once the Implementation Roadmap is complete.
7. Rollout and Stakeholder Communication
A structured rollout and clear communication are essential for a successful launch.

Rollout Strategy:
Phase 1: Internal release to employees for dogfooding.
Phase 2: Canary release to a small percentage of users.
Phase 3: Full production rollout to all users.
Note: The specific strategy will be finalized based on risk assessment after implementation.
Communication Plan:
Pre-Launch: Announce the upcoming feature and timeline to internal stakeholders (Support, Marketing, Sales).
Launch Day: Communicate the successful deployment to all internal teams. Marketing coordinates external announcements.
Post-Launch: Monitor feature performance and user feedback. Share initial metrics with stakeholders within the first week.
Status: BLOCKED. A detailed timeline cannot be created until the Implementation Roadmap is defined.
